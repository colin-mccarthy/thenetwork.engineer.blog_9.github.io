 in OpenShift/Kubernetes pods. Check out this video to see this feature in action.

1. Create a Project/Namespace in OpenShift named (ansible-tower). This can be done in the OpenShift console or via oc/kubectl.

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata: 
  name: ansible-tower

```

2. Create a ServiceAccount named (tower).This can be done in the OpenShift console or via oc/kubectl.

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tower
  namespace: ansible-tower

```

3. Create a Role named (pod-manager).This can be done in the OpenShift console or via oc/kubectl.

```yaml

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-manager
  namespace: ansible-tower
rules:
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - pods
  - verbs:
      - create
    apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - pods/exec

```

4. Create a RoleBinding that binds the pod manager role to the tower service account.This can be done in the OpenShift console or via oc/kubectl.

```yaml

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: ansible-tower
  namespace: ansible-tower
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tower
    namespace: ansible-tower
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: pod-manager

```
