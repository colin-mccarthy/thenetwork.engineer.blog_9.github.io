Today is my last day at Red Hat. 

I’m still shocked that I was able to work with this amazing group of people for over three years. In 2013 I was a Network Engineer working at a small ISP in Colorado. I came across Kirk Byers online, he was teaching an email course titled “Python for Network Engineers”. I took his course and started writing small scripts to execute config changes in our network. It was magical and just such a great feeling to see the automation working. 

A few years later I saw Kirk was putting out blogs about a new tool called Ansible. I followed along with some blogs by Jason and Michael and Kurt. I eventually got it working on my CCNA lab at my house. I was hooked, everyone I spoke with for the next two years got an earful from me about how Ansible was going to change everything. I made a blog and a series of YouTube videos about Ansible for Network Engineers.

I was eventually approached on Linkedin by a recruiter. a few weeks later I   flew from Colorado to Plano Tx to interview for an Ansible Consultant position at Red Hat.  That would be the beginning of an amazing 3 years that would change my life. I have worked with so many amazing customers and Red Hatters in many different states even getting a chance to go to Alaska to teach an Ansible Network workshop.

The time has come for me to take on a new challenge and  continue my automation journey into the Kubernetes and cloud native landscape.  To everyone I have met and worked with over the last few years here I just want to say.. Thank You! You have inspired me to learn and do better, I am proud to have worked beside all of you.
